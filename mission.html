      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Branden’s Safe House is in memory of Branden McKinnnon. It is a Nonprofit for Child Safety, Resources, and protection.</p>
      <p>Everyone needs someone to talk to. As an adult there is a vast array of resources available to support both mental and physical health needs in a private way. Many choose to talk to a therapist or a close friend. Youth that are struggling are often challenged to find safe support. Branden’s Safe House creates a safe space for children to communicate with each other as well as professionals that can provide additional support where needed. Resources create a foundation for opportunity. We provide books, tools, internships, fellowships, and mental health services. And have a network of organizations, volunteers and peers that can help families to build together. We aim to raise awareness to better children’s physical and mental safety and connect them with resources.</p>
      <p>Our children, like many adults, deal with many issues from food insecurity, body and self-insecurities, learning disabilities, mental disabilities, education, mental, and physical health issues. We want to connect them to other children dealing with the same issues and maintaining privacy for them to be open and honest about their feelings. We want to keep Branden’s memory alive and make changes to improve the lives of our children to give them promising futures. 
        To build a safe space and community of unlimited resources for children and their families within Branden’s Safe House to provide our families with assistance and opportunities while engaging them in family fun activities.</p>
