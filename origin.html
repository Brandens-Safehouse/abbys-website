      <h2>About Branden</h2>
      <p>Branden’s SafeHouse is in memory of Branden McKinnon. Branden was a Bright and Brilliant 12 year old that lost his opportunity to a promising future by a loaded service weapon left unsecure in his home on May 19, 2021.
       We don’t know what Branden was going through as we may never know but we want to keep his memory alive with the activities he loved, selfcare, and educational means for the youth.</p>
      <p>Branden was an avid reader and his favorite book series was Percy Jackson. in keeping his memory alive our goal is to provide children with unlimited resources for better opportunities.
       Branden loved animals, rollerblading, arts & crafts, board games, comics, swimming, nature, video games, boys & girls club, family time, movies, amusement parks, and traveling. He traveled
        to 42 of the United States and once out of country. What mattered most to Branden was time and spending it with family and friends. He was always kind to others and willing to lend a helping hand. Branden was 
        curious, fearless, kind, adventurous, helpful, a good listener, well behaved, smart, loving, athletic, energetic, and funny. Percy Jackson was his favorite book series.</p>
